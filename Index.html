	<h2>About me</h2>
	<font size="4">
	<p>I am a 24year Mechatronics and Control Engineering, I graduated from UET Lahore in Aug 2018, Later On I pursued the field of industrial automation, I did a Advanced PLC and SCADA Training course from <b>PITAC</b> and for the last 3 years I have been working in this field. For the past 10years I have been living with Type1 Diabeties and My Story is also featured on the Meethi Zindagi's(NGO in Pakistan) Website as an <i>Inspirational Story</i>, you can read that <a href="https://meethizindagi.org/2021/06/18/type-1-is-not-a-taboo/" title="My Story on Meethi Zindagi Website"><b>here</b></a>, I have also added my story in the <a href="#Story"><b>below </b></a>section.  Apart from diabeties I am also struggling with ACL injury in my knee, due to which I cannot continue my field of industrial automation which I love. So I have opted to shift towards software development and this is first step of development in html.</p>

	<h2>My T1D Story</h2>
	<a name="Story">
	<font size="4">
	<p>Don’t remember the exact date year was 2010, I was in Saudi Arabia back then, the results of the boards exams were about to be announced. And I was awaiting my 9th board result. There were symptoms strange behavior, aggressive thirst, frequent urination, weight loss etc. Most noticeable by my family was strange behavior. My father (Type-2 diabetic) thought that I was under pre result stress. But when the result came, I got around 92%, and on the very next morning my father immediately took me to the hospital, Dr checked my BP, Sugar etc. Sugar was around 400+. Dr immediately wrote detailed tests and referred to the specialist. C peptide, HBA1C and various others tests were done, that day I spent the whole day in hospital, A test which pissed me off was they took blood sample after every hour and gave some fluid to drink it was related to diabetes, when the results came, they showed a diabetic curve and I was declared Type1 Diabetic just like that. On our way back to home my father told me the Dua from last two verses of Surah Baqarah which meaning is as follows  “Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us”, I was really at peace after my father explained this dua and the ayats preceding and succeeding it. After arriving home when my mother knew she said " Allah ! tumhri jagah mjhe ho jati sugar "(May I have had got diabetes inside of you) , and I was left bewildered after hearing that, that day I realized that what a blessings parents are. Learnt and grew a lot on that day, little did I know I thought I won’t be able to eat chocolates anymore so I took the bounty chocolate from the fridge and ate it with tears thinking it’s the last time I am ever going to had that, things got along I can back to Pakistan everyone was showing sympathy and there were many Desi Totkas also but none seem too work miraculously, In my 10th Grade and my college I didn’t use to eat lunch because I had to inject, I was not afraid but the people’s questions made be uncomfortable.  I was still on fixed insulin units and strict diet regulations which were hard because I loved food so I sometimes used to eat secretly which resulted in occasional Hypers my Drs changed my insulin when my HBA1C was at 9ish from novorapid and lantus to Humalog mix 70/30, HBA1C did not improve so Drs shifted me back to Novorapid and Lantus. Then the University Started First year went like college no lunch no friends sat in the University Masjid the whole break, the in the second year things changed I had a road accident in my early college days which resulted in Right knee facture and damaged ACL, at that point my family did not opt for the surgery of ACL as they believed due to my diabetes I would have a hard time recovering, so at the beginning of my second year my ACL got completely ruptured so I had no option but to undergo surgery , post-surgery my family was very afraid of proper recovery and my physiotherapist said your recovery will be very slow due to diabetes but I never loosed hope and gave it my best and after 2 weeks my physiotherapist was astonished by my recovery and told me that he told( to encourage the other patient) another young patient of how I am recovery despite having diabetes. Now due to surgery my teachers and family told me to get my semester freezed but I insisted and went to university on elbow crutches and ALHAMDULILLAH got my semester cleared, few months later I joined Meethi Zindagi fb group and boy! I was happy to learn about carb counting I started learning it and implemented it slowly learning and improvising had few hypo along the way and my diabetic journey after joining after joining MZ and learning carb counting was never the same although still it was tough, Anyways I graduated in BSc Mechatronics and Control Engineering from UET Lahore in 2018, and after graduating my family wanted me to get married, but I was afraid and did not want to marry I used to say why punish someone by getting her married with me, but my family put so much pressure, initially few proposals were rejected due my diabetes, but my family never gave up and then the family my mamo(maternal uncle) agreed, I was amazed and did not believed it I called my cousin (my wife’s brother) and asked is she really OK with this and he said yes and made me realize that it was not big deal, anyways I got married in mid-2019 and was very afraid initially little disputes and differences did occur as she could not fully understand the flexibility of carb counting she used to over-take care of me and I sort of had a loose temper , but things settled she got the hang of it my BG levels amazingly also improved (obviously she kept an eye on me) ,we went through many Hypo and Hypers but she loves as I am and never ever she made me realized that something was wrong with me. But now after 2 years I consider this my achievement that my family is able to fully understand carb counting and I can enjoy meals with them using carb counting. Managing my diabetes at work because being an engineer I had to work at industrial sites is quite challenging, but I didn’t hide the fact that I was diabetic and whenever I went into Hypo I would pause the work and treat it, another tip that helped was taking some fiber rich food like whole wheat biscuit before going to industrial sites which prevented the hypos. Recently I have been blessed with a baby boy (who is fine and healthy ALHAMDULILLAH) and with him I am looking forward towards another amazing chapter of life.</p>
